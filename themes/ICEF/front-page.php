            knowing that the only way to truly support a community is through offering 
            multiple interconnected programs. We stay with the community for as long as 
            it takes for them to achieve self-sustainability.<br> The community drives this
            progressive change, as key stakeholders in all planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of our work. 
            No decisions are made without the input of our community.

        <h3>Our Values</h3>
        <p>ICEF Canada is entirely volunteer driven. Since 2008 our administration
            fees have amounted to less than 1% annually and every dollar donated 
            goes to the Tekera Resource Centre. We believe that big chances come 
            when money is spent efficiently and towards the projects that need it the most.
            As a small but impactful organization we pride ourselves on 100% transparency and direct impact.
